# Node Code Snippets

The code snippets present in this repository serve the main purpose of displaying my code style and a little bit of the experience that I have gained working on a variety of projects. 

These are only snippets because I may not be able to freely upload previous project code for obvious reasons.

These being only snippets of code, it means that the code is incomplete and will most likely show a disconnect somewhere along the way.

The code present will not be maintain or kept up to date, however, once I have new code that I believe is useful and/or a beautiful work of art, then I will definitely add it.
